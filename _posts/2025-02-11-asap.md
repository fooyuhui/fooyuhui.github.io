> Takeaway: We can train a delta (residual) action model to compensate for the dynamics mismatch.

You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.0114).

## Method

Two-stage training process:

Pre-traing: learning agile humanoid skills in simulation.

- Retargeting human video data.
- Phase-based motion tracking policy training.
  
Fine-tuning: aligning simulation and real-world physics.

- Train a delta (residual) action model to compensate for the dynamics mismatch using roll-out data from the pre-trained policy.
- Freeze the delta action model and fine-tune the pre-trained policy using RL.
- Deploy the fine-tuned policy on the real robot.

## Conclusion

The idea of using a delta action model and real-world data to align simulation with real-world physics is intriguing.
