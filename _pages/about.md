I am currently a master's student at the [School of Computer Science, Peking University](https://cs.pku.edu.cn), under the supervision of [Prof. Zongqing Lu](https://z0ngqing.github.io/). I previously obtained a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from the [Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn).

My research interests focus on **reinforcement learning** and **robotics**, with the aim of enabling robots to tackle complex open-world problems.

If you would like to communicate or collaborate with me, feel free to send me an email.
